  {
   "cell_type": "markdown",
   "metadata": {},
   "source": [
    "* Charge flow in a BJT is due to diffusion of charge carriers across a junction between two regions of different charge concentrations\n",
    "\n",
    "* The regions of a BJT are called emitter, collector, and base \n",
    "\n",
    "* A discrete transistor has three leads for connection to these regions. Typically, the emitter region is heavily doped compared to the other two layers \n",
    "\n",
    "* Majority charge carrier concentrations in base and collector layers are about the same \n",
    "\n",
    "* Collector doping is typically ten times lighter than base doping\n",
    "\n",
    "* By design, most of the BJT collector current is due to the flow of charge carriers (electrons or holes) injected from a high-concentration emitter into the base where they are minority carriers that diffuse toward the collector\n",
    "\n",
    "* BJTs are classified as minority-carrier devices.\n",
    "\n",
    "## In typical operation:\n",
    "\n",
    "* the base–emitter junction is forward-biased, which means that the p-doped side of the junction is at a more positive potential than the n-doped side, \n",
    "\n",
    "* base–collector junction is reverse-biased\n",
    "\n",
    "## Example\n",
    "\n",
    "* In an NPN transistor, when positive bias is applied to the base–emitter junction, the equilibrium is disturbed between the thermally generated carriers and the repelling electric field of the n-doped emitter depletion region\n",
    "\n",
    "## Consequence\n",
    "\n",
    "* This allows thermally excited electrons to inject from the emitter into the base region. These electrons diffuse through the base from the region of high concentration near the emitter toward the region of low concentration near the collector. \n",
    "\n",
    "* The electrons in the base are called minority carriers because the base is doped p-type, which makes holes the majority carrier in the base.\n",
    "\n",
    "* To minimize the fraction of carriers that recombine before reaching the collector–base junction, the transistor's base region must be thin enough that carriers can diffuse across it in much less time than the semiconductor's minority-carrier lifetime.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Required for \"active region, transistor like\" operation:\n",
    "\n",
    "* The thickness of the base must be much less than the diffusion length of the electrons.  This requires the base to be very thin. \n",
    "\n",
    "* The collector–base junction is reverse-biased, and so little electron injection occurs from the collector to the base, but electrons that diffuse through the base towards the collector are swept into the collector by the electric field in the depletion region of the collector–base junction. \n",
    "\n",
    "* The thin shared base and asymmetric collector–emitter doping are what differentiates a bipolar transistor from two separate and oppositely biased diodes connected in series."
